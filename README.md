# Depression_Insights


Depression Insights
This project leverages machine learning to analyze and predict depression based on psychological assessment scores (PHQ-9, GAD-7, Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and demographic attributes (age, gender, BMI). By combining multiple data points, it aims to support early detection and provide actionable insights for mental health care.

Features
Predicts depression likelihood with high accuracy using advanced ML models.
Integrates psychological scores and demographic data for a comprehensive analysis.
Visualizes insights with feature importance charts and AUC-ROC curves.
Provides explainable predictions to assist healthcare professionals.
Technologies Used
Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
Future Enhancements
Real-time data collection integration (e.g., wearables).
Expanding datasets to include diverse populations.
Extending the methodology to other mental health conditions.
